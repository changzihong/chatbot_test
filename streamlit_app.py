            "where can i find cheap food": "üçï The food court near the West Gate is known for its affordable and diverse stalls. The pizza place there is a personal favorite for a quick and cheap slice!",
            "how do i meet new people": "ü§ù Honestly, just by showing up! Join a club or a sports team, volunteer for an event, or just hang out in the common areas. Everyone is in the same boat, so just be open and friendly!",
            "what is the campus shuttle schedule": "üöå The campus shuttle runs pretty often on weekdays, but the schedule can be a bit tricky to memorize. I usually just check the university's official app for the live tracker. It saves a ton of time!",
            "how do i talk to my professor": "ü§î Don't be intimidated! Most professors have office hours and they're usually happy to help. Just send them a quick email to ask if you can stop by to chat about the class or a topic you're interested in.",
